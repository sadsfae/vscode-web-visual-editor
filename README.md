## Alternatives
This extension is similar to [microsoft/vscode\-livepreview](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-livepreview) and it differs in the following points:

- The ability to synchronize code selection with visual selection in the preview.
- Since Web Visual Editor has minimal functionality, the codebase is very small, making future expansions easy.
- It is designed to reflect changes made in the preview back to the code, so enhancing the editing capabilities within the preview may be beneficial in the future. For example, you can copy, cut, paste and delete elements within preview at this moment.
